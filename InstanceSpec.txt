Instance Spec, v4

* http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/instance-spec

Does nothing in Legion for now. If spec switching returns, it will automatically resume previous functionality.

Before Legion this addon used to add a button below dungeon ready dialog that would allow you to quickly switch to your other spec if you need it to match your assigned role.
